Summary

In our study of 2000 songs from six different decades, we found some interesting connections between different aspects of the songs. Surprisingly, we noticed that there were 150% more songs than we initially thought when we started the project. However, making a successful model was tough because the songs varied a lot in style and genre. We also faced challenges with Spotify, as some songs were remastered and listed as newer than the original releases, making it tricky to manage the data. In the end, our research shows that predicting music trends is complex, thanks to the ever-changing nature of the music world.
